title: "Weekly field placement schedules"
subtitle: "Suggested schedule"
---

This schedule is designed to provide you with a comprehensive and progressive experience during your field experience in a bilingual school setting, covering 8 of the total required weeks. The schedule is divided into three main phases: observation (weeks 1-4), support and individual tutoring (weeks 5-6), and mini-lessons and whole class activities (after week 6). This structure will allow you to gradually build your skills and confidence in supporting instruction in an international and comparative education context, moving from passive observation to active teaching. Each week focuses on a specific aspect of bilingual instruction, cultural integration, or comparative educational practices.

To maximize the benefits of your field placement, you are required to maintain a detailed field placement log. 

Your log should track all the information outlined in the third column of the schedule below. Your log entries should include the date, specific observation notes, reflections on teaching strategies in both languages, notes on student interactions across cultures, and your personal growth throughout the experience. Pay particular attention to documenting the progression of your involvement, from initial observations to leading bilingual class activities. This log will serve as a valuable resource for your professional development in international education, helping you identify areas of strength and opportunities for improvement. Additionally, it will provide concrete examples and experiences to draw upon during future job interviews or when developing your teaching philosophy in a global context.

## Overview of Colombia

Colombia, situated at the northern tip of South America, is a country of remarkable diversity and charm. Boasting a population of over 50 million, it's a melting pot of cultures, from indigenous communities to descendants of Spanish colonizers and African slaves. The country spans a variety of landscapes, from the Andes Mountains to the Amazon rainforest, Caribbean and Pacific coastlines.

# Trip Schedule

Our trip will be hosted by [ORIGIN+CULTURE](https://www.instagram.com/originandculture/?hl=en){target="_blank"}, a Howard-alumna run Colombian-local travel organization.

> Origin + Culture provides immersive travel and cultural experiences that celebrate Afro- Colombian heritage. Alongside our curated tours, we also host an English Club to support language learning, engage in volunteer projects, and work closely with local businesses to develop and stimulate the Black economy. Through these activities, we create connections across the international Black diaspora and offer opportunities to learn about the impact of Afro-Colombian history, culture, and traditions. Each of our services is designed to support local communities and provide guests with authentic, and thought provoking experiences.

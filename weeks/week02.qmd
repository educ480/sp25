## Introduction

-   Ethnocentrism: Viewing one's culture as superior to others
:::

## Ethnocentrism

Ethnocentrism is the tendency to view one's own culture as superior and to judge other cultures based on the standards of one's own. Here are some examples of ethnocentrism:

1.  Judging other countries' diets: Many Americans might find the Peruvian practice of eating guinea pigs disgusting, without considering that it's a normal part of Peruvian cuisine.

2.  Expecting others to speak English: English speakers often expect people in other countries to communicate with them in English, even when visiting non-English speaking nations

3.  Accents: People often believe they don't have an accent while others do, failing to recognize that everyone has an accent from someone else's perspective

4.  Religious celebrations: Attempts to suppress or delegitimize other cultures' religious practices, such as China's efforts to restrict Ramadan celebrations in the Muslim region of Xinjiang

5.  Clothing norms: Judging other cultures' traditional dress based on one's own cultural standards of appropriate attire

### Ethnocentrism in Education

Ethnocentrism in education can lead to:

-   Biased interpretations of cultural differences
-   Impact on student belonging
-   Impact on classroom dynamics

### Nationalism in Curriculum

Nationalism influences education through:

-   Shaping of curriculum design and content, often centering those in power
-   Promotion of national identity in history and social studies
    -   While this may be important at some times, it can be harmful in certain contexts.

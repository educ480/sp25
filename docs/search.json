    "section": "",
    "text": "Classical educational theories have shaped the foundation of modern pedagogy and classroom practices. These theories, developed primarily in the Western context, have been influential globally. However, as education becomes increasingly internationalized, newer theories focusing on cultural relevance and sustainability have gained important prominence in terms of how we think about teaching and learning, especially in diverse and multicultural settings.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries, European colonizers significantly impacted education systems worldwide with a set of narrow beliefs. For example, in 1835, Thomas Babington Macaulay introduced a public education system in India aimed at creating an English-speaking, anglicized class of Indians to serve as cultural intermediaries. This event highlights how education was used as a tool for cultural and political influence, emphasizing the importance of considering diverse cultural contexts in educational theories. In what is now known as the United States, we read of histories of the assimilation-focused boarding schools for Native children and youth.\n\n\n\nThe Scream (2016) by Kent Monkman\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the 20th century, we witness a dramatic expansion of public education systems globally. This growth was driven by the need for social cohesion in increasingly complex and politicized societies. Émile Durkheim, a French sociologist, for example, argued that education served to transmit core values and create a sense of “social being,” a concept that became particularly relevant as newly independent states in Africa and Asia established their own education systems post-World War II. We should be mindful that many of these states that gained independence were previously colonized, and so the development of these new systems was heavily implicated by these histories.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorld War II had a profound impact on education, demonstrating that educational systems at the national level could influence global events. The war’s outcome was partly attributed to scientific and technological advancements, leading to significant expansions in education. In the United States, this manifested as the G.I. Bill, which provided funding for returning servicemen to attend college, setting off a boom in higher education. We also saw instances of injustice taking place, such as the Japanese Interment Camps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe late 20th century brought unprecedented access to information through the expansion of the internet and new digital tools. This technological revolution has transformed education, making it more accessible and flexible for all learners. This change has been reflected in the development of niche schools (such as charter schools) and new educational programming that has resulted in a host of social and political perspectives. The rise of online courses, virtual classrooms, and educational apps has necessitated a reevaluation of traditional educational theories to accommodate these new learning environments.\n\n\n\nGlobal image of different nations\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic forced a rapid shift to online learning, highlighting both challenges and opportunities in remote education. This global event has accelerated the need to adapt educational theories to accommodate diverse learning environments and technological integration. This and other historical events underscore the importance of considering educational theories within an international context, as education continues to be shaped by global forces, cultural exchanges, and technological advancements.\n\n\n\nStudent learning with a mask during Covid-19"

His address discussed the purpose of education and the challenges faced by educators in a society grappling with racial injustice. Baldwin’s speech emphasizes several key points:\n\nThe purpose of education is to create individuals capable of thinking critically and examining their society.\nThere is a paradox in education: as students become more conscious, they begin to question the very society educating them.\nBaldwin argues that the role of teachers, especially those working with African American children, is to help students understand and confront the societal injustices they face.\nHe also challenges educators to prepare students to change society, even if it means facing resistance.",

One of these colleagues mentions a 3-day anti-racist summer program for teachers that they attended. They remark on how impactful the program was and they describe a set of five or six Afrocentric activities that they have created for everyone in your grade band to implement. This teacher has been at the school since last year, and they are new to the state.\nAlmost immediately, the other colleague, who has been around at the school for more than a decade, asks if a similar curriculum will also be done for other groups. The first colleague says: “not as far as I know,” in response. After about five minutes of additional (back-and-forth) discussion, the two colleagues realize that they may disagree on the issue.\nYou are asked by both of your new colleagues for your opinion. Specifically, they want to know if it is okay to only do the Afrocentric curriculum or if they are also responsible for having additional curricula for other groups.\nWhat is your position?",

In 1928, Bunche joined the faculty of Howard University, where he founded the Political Science Department. He was the first African American to earn a Ph.D. in political science from Harvard University in 1934.\nThe Ralph J. Bunch International Affairs Center, Directed by Dr. Tonija Hope, is located here at Howard!\nHis groundbreaking diplomatic work transformed international relations. In 1946, he joined the United Nations as director of the Trusteeship Division and in 1949 successfully negotiated armistice agreements between Israel and four Arab states, for which he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1950, becoming the first African American and person of color to receive this honor. Bunche’s influence extended to the civil rights movement, participating in key events like the 1963 March on Washington and the 1965 Selma to Montgomery Voting Rights March alongside Martin Luther King Jr.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMary McCleod Bethune\n\n\nMary McLeod Bethune was born on July 10, 1875 in Mayesville, South Carolina. She was the first of her 17 siblings to be born free from slavery. She became a pioneering educator, civil rights activist, and a women’s rights advocate. In 1904, Bethune founded the Daytona Normal and Industrial Training Institute for Negro Girls with just $1.50, which later merged with Cookman Institute to become Bethune-Cookman College, now a university. She also established the first hospital for Black people in Daytona Beach, Florida, in 1911.\nBethune’s work had a significant impact on international affairs and education.\nShe was the only woman of color at the founding conference of the United Nations in 1945, where she served as an associate consultant to the US delegation in drafting the UN charter. Her focus during these negotiations was on the rights of people living in colonized countries worldwide. Bethune’s Pan-African activism extended her influence throughout the African diaspora, as she worked to create solidarity among Africans globally through her writings and travels.",

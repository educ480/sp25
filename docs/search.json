Schools began a staged implementation of the standards during the 2011-12 school year. From 2011-2014, teachers received ongoing training in Common Core implementation, with full implementation occurring during the 2014-15 school year.\nThe CCSS-Mathematics demand a shift in math instruction from an emphasis on procedural fluency towards a balance between procedural fluency, conceptual understanding and application of concepts, so students are better prepared for the critical thinking necessary to succeed in college, careers and their daily lives. OSSE seeks to support high-quality implementation of the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics.\nFind more information by clicking here",

    "text": "This schedule is designed to provide you with a comprehensive and progressive experience during your field experience in a bilingual school setting, covering 8 of the total required weeks. The schedule is divided into three main phases: observation (weeks 1-4), support and individual tutoring (weeks 5-6), and mini-lessons and whole class activities (after week 6). This structure will allow you to gradually build your skills and confidence in supporting instruction in an international and comparative education context, moving from passive observation to active teaching. Each week focuses on a specific aspect of bilingual instruction, cultural integration, or comparative educational practices.\nTo maximize the benefits of your field placement, you are required to maintain a detailed field placement log.\nYour log should track all the information outlined in the third column of the schedule below. Your log entries should include the date, specific observation notes, reflections on teaching strategies in both languages, notes on student interactions across cultures, and your personal growth throughout the experience. Pay particular attention to documenting the progression of your involvement, from initial observations to leading bilingual class activities. This log will serve as a valuable resource for your professional development in international education, helping you identify areas of strength and opportunities for improvement. Additionally, it will provide concrete examples and experiences to draw upon during future job interviews or when developing your teaching philosophy in a global context.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek\nMain Task\nSuggestions\n\n\n\n\n1\nObserve bilingual class routines\nTake notes on language transition strategies and cultural integration in daily activities\n\n\n2\nObserve instructional techniques in both languages\nFocus on content and language integrated learning (CLIL) strategies and cross-cultural comparisons\n\n\n3\nObserve student interactions during bilingual activities\nNote language preferences, cultural dynamics, and how the teacher addresses intercultural communication\n\n\n4\nObserve assessment practices in a bilingual setting\nPay attention to language-specific assessment techniques and culturally responsive feedback\n\n\n5\nProvide one-on-one support to a student in their weaker language\nAssist students and practice explaining concepts clearly while bridging language gaps\n\n\n6\nLead a group tutorial on a topic, alternating between both languages\nPrepare mini-lessons that incorporate comparative perspectives on the subject matter\n\n\n7\nCo-teach a full bilingual lesson with the mentor teacher\nPlan and deliver portions of the lesson in both languages, integrating international perspectives\n\n\n8\nLead a class activity or game that promotes intercultural understanding\nDesign an engaging activity that reinforces key concepts while celebrating cultural diversity",

    "text": "Theorist\nTheory/Focus\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nJames Banks\nMulticultural Education\nDeveloped a framework for integrating multicultural content into curricula, emphasizing five dimensions: content integration, knowledge construction, prejudice reduction, equity pedagogy, and empowering school culture.\n\n\nDjango Paris\nCulturally Sustaining Pedagogy\nExtends culturally relevant pedagogy by focusing on sustaining linguistic, literate, and cultural pluralism as part of schooling for positive social transformation.\n\n\nCarter G. Woodson\nBlack Education\nAdvocated for the importance of Black history in education, founded Negro History Week (now Black History Month), and critiqued the “mis-education” of African Americans in his seminal work.\n\n\nBob Moses\nLiteracy Education\nCombined civil rights activism with litearcy education, viewing litearcy in areas like math as a civil right and tool for empowerment in underserved communities.\n\n\nPaulo Freire\nEducation for Liberation\nDeveloped critical pedagogy, emphasizing dialogue, critical consciousness, and the idea that education should be a practice of freedom rather than domination.\n\n\nJo-ann Archibald Q’um Q’um Xiiem\nIndigenous Storywork\nDeveloped a theoretical framework for using Indigenous stories in education, emphasizing seven principles: respect, responsibility, reciprocity, reverence, holism, interrelatedness, and synergy.\n\n\nBryan McKinley Jones Brayboy\nTribal Critical Race Theory\nExtends Critical Race Theory to address the specific needs of Indigenous peoples, emphasizing the role of storytelling in theory-building and Indigenous knowledge systems.\n\n\nAlbert Bandura\nObservational Learning Theory\nBehavior can be learned through observation of others.\n\n\nAsa Hilliard\nAfrican-Centered Education\nEmphasized the importance of cultural identity in education, particularly for African American students. Advocated for curriculum that includes African and African American history and culture.\n\n\nAbraham Maslow\nHierarchy of Needs\nHumans naturally strive to satisfy needs. The five levels of needs, from lowest to highest, are: physiological, safety, love, esteem, self-actualization. Lower level needs must be satisfied before the individual can move on to satisfy higher level needs.\n\n\nCarol Dweck\nGrowth Mindset\nProposes that students’ beliefs about their intelligence can significantly affect their motivation and achievement. Contrasts “fixed mindset” with “growth mindset” and its implications for learning.\n\n\nErik Erikson\nSocioemotional Development\nErikson’s “Eight Stages of Man” describes a series of crises individuals pass through at different ages. The stages begin with “trust versus mistrust” in infancy and continue through a series of paired outcomes for each age through older adulthood.\n\n\nFestinger, Leon\nCognitive Dissonance\nInconsistencies between behaviors and beliefs motivate people to change. One basis for constructivism.\n\n\nFreud, Sigmund\nLevels of Consciousness\nThe mind operates at different levels: conscious versus unconscious. He further subdivided the mind into the id (primitive motivations), ego (logical portion of the mind which acts to satisfy the id - when possible), and the super-ego (the conscience).\n\n\nGloria Ladson-Billings\nCulturally Relevant Pedagogy\nEmphasizes the importance of including students’ cultural backgrounds in all aspects of learning. Proposes that culturally relevant teaching must meet three criteria: academic success, cultural competence, and critical consciousness.\n\n\nHoward Gardner\nMultiple Intelligences\nEach individual possesses seven distinct and measurable forms of intelligence: linguistic, logical-mathematical, spatial, body-kinesthetic, musical, intrapersonal, and interpersonal.\n\n\nIvan Pavlov\nClassical Conditioning (Behaviorism)\nThe association of new responses with existing stimulus-response pairs. Classic example is pairing the ringing of a bell with presentation of food to dogs. After repeated pairing, the dogs will salivate upon hearing the bell (even if food is not presented). Original stimulus (S) response (R) pair is food – salivate. New S-R pair is bell – salivate.\n\n\nJarvis Givens\nFugitive Pedagogy\nExplores the hidden tradition of Black teaching, focusing on how African American educators historically navigated oppressive systems to provide quality education. Emphasizes the importance of understanding this history in current educational practices.\n\n\nJean Piaget\nDevelopmental Epistemology\nDevelopmental stages of child development: 0-2 years: “sensorimotor” - motor development; 3-7 years: “preoperation” - intuitive; 8-11 years: “concrete operational” - logical, but non-abstract; 12-15 years: “formal operations” - abstract thinking\n\n\nJerome Bruner\nConstructivist Theory\nIndividuals actively construct knowledge by comparing new ideas or concepts with their current knowledge (schema or mental models).\n\n\nJohn Dewey\nLearning by Doing\nLearning occurs through experience.\n\n\nJohn Hattie\nVisible Learning\nSynthesizes meta-analyses to identify the most effective teaching strategies. Emphasizes the importance of evidence-based practice in education.\n\n\nKen Robinson\nCreativity in Education\nAdvocates for transforming education to nurture creativity and divergent thinking. Critiques standardized education and promotes personalized, diverse learning experiences.\n\n\nLawrence Kohlberg\nStages of Moral Development\nPre-Conventional - based on self-centered interests; Conventional - based on conformity to local expectations; Post-Conventional - based on higher principles\n\n\nLocke, John\nTabula Rasa\nThe idea that individuals are “blank slates” on which teachers could “write” knowledge. A forerunner of behaviorism.\n\n\nLev Vygotsky\nSocial Development Theory and ZPD\nSocial interaction is critical for cognitive development. Related to this is the idea of a “Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD).” Some skills, an individual can perform independently. Other skills can be performed if the individual has assistance. Skills that can be performed with assistance are said to be within an individual’s ZPD. The ZPD is the theoretical basis for scaffolding.\n\n\nRogers, Carl\nExperiential Learning\nTwo types of knowledge: academic and experiential. Unlike academic knowledge, experiential knowledge is acquired to meet the needs of the learner, usually to complete an important, real-life task. Example: Learning to drive a car.\n\n\nSkinner, B.F.\nOperant Conditioning (Behaviorism)\nLearning is the result of changes in behavior. As stimulus-response cycles are reinforced, individuals are “conditioned” to respond. Distinguished from Connectionism because individuals can initiate responses, not merely respond to stimuli.\n\n\nThorndike, Edward\nConnectionism (Behaviorism)\nLearners form associations or connections between a stimulus and a response. Through trial and error, rewarded responses would be strengthened.\n\n\nWatson, John\nBehaviorism\nProposed that most human learning and behavior was controlled by experience (not genetically pre-determined). Believed the only behaviors that should be studied are the “observable” ones.\n\n\nWertheimer, Max\nGestalt Theory\nSome ideas can only be understood as part of a “bigger picture,” important in problem-solving."

    "text": "Ralph Bunche\n\n\nRalph Johnson Bunche was born on August 7, 1904 in Detroit, Michigan. He became a pioneering diplomat, academic, and civil rights activist. In 1928, Bunche joined the faculty of Howard University, where he founded the Political Science Department. He was the first African American to earn a Ph.D. in political science from Harvard University in 1934.\nThe Ralph J. Bunch International Affairs Center, Directed by Dr. Tonija Hope, is located here at Howard!\nHis groundbreaking diplomatic work transformed international relations. In 1946, he joined the United Nations as director of the Trusteeship Division and in 1949 successfully negotiated armistice agreements between Israel and four Arab states, for which he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1950, becoming the first African American and person of color to receive this honor. Bunche’s influence extended to the civil rights movement, participating in key events like the 1963 March on Washington and the 1965 Selma to Montgomery Voting Rights March alongside Martin Luther King Jr.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMary McCleod Bethune\n\n\nMary McLeod Bethune was born on July 10, 1875 in Mayesville, South Carolina. She was the first of her 17 siblings to be born free from slavery. She became a pioneering educator, civil rights activist, and a women’s rights advocate. In 1904, Bethune founded the Daytona Normal and Industrial Training Institute for Negro Girls with just $1.50, which later merged with Cookman Institute to become Bethune-Cookman College, now a university. She also established the first hospital for Black people in Daytona Beach, Florida, in 1911.\nBethune’s work had a significant impact on international affairs and education.\nShe was the only woman of color at the founding conference of the United Nations in 1945, where she served as an associate consultant to the US delegation in drafting the UN charter. Her focus during these negotiations was on the rights of people living in colonized countries worldwide. Bethune’s Pan-African activism extended her influence throughout the African diaspora, as she worked to create solidarity among Africans globally through her writings and travels.",

In what is now known as the United States, we read of histories of the assimilation-focused boarding schools for Native children and youth.\n\n\n\nThe Scream (2016) by Kent Monkman",

    "text": "In the 20th century, we witness a dramatic expansion of public education systems globally. This growth was driven by the need for social cohesion in increasingly complex and politicized societies. Émile Durkheim, a French sociologist, for example, argued that education served to transmit core values and create a sense of “social being,” a concept that became particularly relevant as newly independent states in Africa and Asia established their own education systems post-World War II. We should be mindful that many of these states that gained independence were previously colonized, and so the development of these new systems was heavily implicated by these histories.",

The war’s outcome was partly attributed to scientific and technological advancements, leading to significant expansions in education. In the United States, this manifested as the G.I. Bill, which provided funding for returning servicemen to attend college, setting off a boom in higher education. We also saw instances of injustice taking place, such as the Japanese Interment Camps.",

    "text": "This page provides language for your cooperating teachers along information for you both to review related to the expectations of your field placement.\n\nSample Welcome Letter for Cooperating Teachers\nDear Teacher Colleagues,\nThank you for partnering in our field experience.\nYour role is crucial in helping to shape the next generation of Howard University prepared educators. This 30-hour per week field placement is designed to provide our students with a comprehensive classroom experience. We ask for your support in guiding them through observations, one-on-one tutoring, and eventually leading a lesson or activities.\nYour mentoring will be invaluable as our pre-service teachers progress from observers to active participants in your classroom. We appreciate your willingness to share your expertise, provide constructive feedback, and create opportunities for our students to apply their learning.\nPlease review the field experience expectations below. If you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to contact our field placement coordinator, Dr. Renix, or me, Dr. Nathan Alexander (the instructor for the course).\nThank you again for your commitment to teacher education.\nWarm regards, Prof. Alexander\n\n\nField Log Expectations\nOur future teachers are required to maintain a detailed field experience log throughout their placement. This log serves as a reflective tool and a record of your growth, so they may be taking notes during their time in your classroom. Here are some general expectations for their log:\n\nRegular notes: Make entries during or after each field experience session.\nContent: Include detailed observations, reflections on teaching strategies, notes on student interactions, and personal growth insights. NO student names or personal information should be included.\nStructure: Organize log by date and time and align entries with the weekly tasks and suggestions provided in the schedule here.\nReflection: Include thoughts on what is learned, questions that arise, and ideas for future implementation in your own teaching.\nConnections: Draw links between your observations and the educational theories and methods from class.\nSpecificity: Provide concrete examples and avoid generalizations. Here, you may use pseudonyms or numbers (e.g., student 1, student 2) to protect student privacy.\nProfessional Growth: Document your progression from observer to active teacher, noting challenges and successes along the way.\n\nYour field experience log will be reviewed periodically by your university supervisor and will form part of your overall assessment for the placement.\n\n\nAttendance Expectations\nConsistent attendance is crucial for a meaningful field experience. Here are our course’s attendance expectations:\n\nDuration: The field placement consists of a minimum of 30 hours per week.\nScheduling: Work with your cooperating teacher to establish a regular schedule that fits both your needs and the classroom’s schedule.\nPunctuality: Arrive at least 10 minutes before your scheduled time to prepare for the day’s activities.\nAbsences: If you must miss a scheduled session due to illness or emergency, notify both your cooperating teacher and Dr. Alexander via email as soon as possible.

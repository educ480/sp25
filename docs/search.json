    "text": "Mary McCleod Bethune\n\n\nMary McLeod Bethune was born on July 10, 1875 in Mayesville, South Carolina. She was the first of her 17 siblings to be born free from slavery. She became a pioneering educator, civil rights activist, and a women’s rights advocate. In 1904, Bethune founded the Daytona Normal and Industrial Training Institute for Negro Girls with just $1.50, which later merged with Cookman Institute to become Bethune-Cookman College, now a university. She also established the first hospital for Black people in Daytona Beach, Florida, in 1911.\nBethune’s work had a significant impact on international affairs and education.\nShe was the only woman of color at the founding conference of the United Nations in 1945, where she served as an associate consultant to the US delegation in drafting the UN charter. Her focus during these negotiations was on the rights of people living in colonized countries worldwide. Bethune’s Pan-African activism extended her influence throughout the African diaspora, as she worked to create solidarity among Africans globally through her writings and travels.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe site photo is from Wikimedia Commons.",

In education, globalization has led to greater collaboration between nations but has also raised questions about cultural homogenization and educational equity.\n\n\nComparative Education\nComparative education involves analyzing education systems across different countries or regions to identify similarities, differences, and best practices. It provides insights into how historical, cultural, political, and economic factors influence educational outcomes.\n\n\nCultural Competency\nCultural competency is the ability to understand, respect, and effectively interact with people from diverse cultural backgrounds.

From 2011-2014, teachers received ongoing training in Common Core implementation, with full implementation occurring during the 2014-15 school year.\nThe CCSS-Mathematics demand a shift in math instruction from an emphasis on procedural fluency towards a balance between procedural fluency, conceptual understanding and application of concepts, so students are better prepared for the critical thinking necessary to succeed in college, careers and their daily lives. OSSE seeks to support high-quality implementation of the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics.\nFind more information by clicking here",

Advocated for curriculum that includes African and African American history and culture.\n\n\nAlan Baddeley\n-\n-\n\n\nAbraham Maslow\nHierarchy of Needs\nHumans naturally strive to satisfy needs. The five levels of needs, from lowest to highest, are: physiological, safety, love, esteem, self-actualization. Lower level needs must be satisfied before the individual can move on to satisfy higher level needs.\n\n\nCarol Dweck\nGrowth Mindset\nProposes that students’ beliefs about their intelligence can significantly affect their motivation and achievement. Contrasts “fixed mindset” with “growth mindset” and its implications for learning.\n\n\nDavid Kolb\n-\n-\n\n\nDonald Broadbent\n-\n-\n\n\nErik Erikson\nSocioemotional Development\nErikson’s “Eight Stages of Man” describes a series of crises individuals pass through at different ages. The stages begin with “trust versus mistrust” in infancy and continue through a series of paired outcomes for each age through older adulthood.\n\n\nFestinger, Leon\nCognitive Dissonance\nInconsistencies between behaviors and beliefs motivate people to change. One basis for constructivism.\n\n\nFreud, Sigmund\nLevels of Consciousness\nThe mind operates at different levels: conscious versus unconscious. He further subdivided the mind into the id (primitive motivations), ego (logical portion of the mind which acts to satisfy the id - when possible), and the super-ego (the conscience).\n\n\nGloria Ladson-Billings\nCulturally Relevant Pedagogy\nEmphasizes the importance of including students’ cultural backgrounds in all aspects of learning. Proposes that culturally relevant teaching must meet three criteria: academic success, cultural competence, and critical consciousness.\n\n\nHoward Gardner\nMultiple Intelligences\nEach individual possesses seven distinct and measurable forms of intelligence: linguistic, logical-mathematical, spatial, body-kinesthetic, musical, intrapersonal, and interpersonal.\n\n\nIvan Pavlov\nClassical Conditioning (Behaviorism)\nThe association of new responses with existing stimulus-response pairs. Classic example is pairing the ringing of a bell with presentation of food to dogs. After repeated pairing, the dogs will salivate upon hearing the bell (even if food is not presented). Original stimulus (S) response (R) pair is food – salivate. New S-R pair is bell – salivate.\n\n\nJarvis Givens\nFugitive Pedagogy\nExplores the hidden tradition of Black teaching, focusing on how African American educators historically navigated oppressive systems to provide quality education. Emphasizes the importance of understanding this history in current educational practices.\n\n\nJean Piaget\nGenetic Epistemology\nDevelopmental stages of child development: 0-2 years: “sensorimotor” - motor development; 3-7 years: “preoperation” - intuitive; 8-11 years: “concrete operational” - logical, but non-abstract; 12-15 years: “formal operations” - abstract thinking\n\n\nJerome Bruner\nConstructivist Theory\nIndividuals actively construct knowledge by comparing new ideas or concepts with their current knowledge (schema or mental models).\n\n\nJohn Dewey\nLearning by Doing\nLearning occurs through experience.\n\n\nJohn Hattie\nVisible Learning\nSynthesizes meta-analyses to identify the most effective teaching strategies. Emphasizes the importance of evidence-based practice in education.\n\n\nKen Robinson\nCreativity in Education\nAdvocates for transforming education to nurture creativity and divergent thinking. Critiques standardized education and promotes personalized, diverse learning experiences.\n\n\nLawrence Kohlberg\nStages of Moral Development\nPre-Conventional - based on self-centered interests; Conventional - based on conformity to local expectations; Post-Conventional - based on higher principles\n\n\nLocke, John\nTabula Rasa\nThe idea that individuals are “blank slates” on which teachers could “write” knowledge. A forerunner of behaviorism.\n\n\nLev Vygotsky\nSocial Development Theory and ZPD\nSocial interaction is critical for cognitive development. Related to this is the idea of a “Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD).” Some skills, an individual can perform independently. Other skills can be performed if the individual has assistance. Skills that can be performed with assistance are said to be within an individual’s ZPD. The ZPD is the theoretical basis for scaffolding.\n\n\nPedro Noguera\nUrban Education and Equity\nFocuses on the ways in which schools are influenced by social and economic conditions in urban settings. Advocates for strategies to improve the academic achievement of students from diverse backgrounds.\n\n\nRogers, Carl\nExperiential Learning\nTwo types of knowledge: academic and experiential. Unlike academic knowledge, experiential knowledge is acquired to meet the needs of the learner, usually to complete an important, real-life task. Example: Learning to drive a car.\n\n\nSkinner, B.F.\nOperant Conditioning (Behaviorism)\nLearning is the result of changes in behavior. As stimulus-response cycles are reinforced, individuals are “conditioned” to respond. Distinguished from Connectionism because individuals can initiate responses, not merely respond to stimuli.\n\n\nThorndike, Edward\nConnectionism (Behaviorism)\nLearners form associations or connections between a stimulus and a response. Through trial and error, rewarded responses would be strengthened.\n\n\nWatson, John\nBehaviorism\nProposed that most human learning and behavior was controlled by experience (not genetically pre-determined). Believed the only behaviors that should be studied are the “observable” ones.\n\n\nWertheimer, Max\nGestalt Theory\nSome ideas can only be understood as part of a “bigger picture,” important in problem-solving."

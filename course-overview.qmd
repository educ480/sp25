### **Canvas**

Canvas is the go-to for submissions, and where you can find readings and assignment rubrics. [Here](https://canvas.howard.edu/courses/58654/) is another link to Canvas, I'll try to drop these as often as possible. Two things about Canvas: it has your **assignments** and it has your **readings**.

#### Canvas has your course assignments

::: incremental
The four categories for **assignments** in this course are as follows:

-   **Reflection and readings** \[20 points\]
-   **International trip assignments** \[20 points\]
-   **Lesson/unit plan and presentations** \[40 points\]
-   **Field placement log and excursions** \[20 points\]

### **A few other items**

#### Expectations

This course will help you gain both a conceptual and theoretical understanding of the various concepts we will explore, and then a technical understanding of the complex issues that relate to them. We also want to communicate our ideas. These can be difficult tasks. But I encourage you to explore and to be creative, and to take chances. Errors should mostly remind us that there is always the backspace button. Below are some general **expectations** to keep us all moving forward as a community:

::: incremental
-   Communicate early and often
-   Show up to class on time
-   Do not schedule other meetings during class time
-   No late work will be accepted without prior discussion

You can return to this page to remind yourself of the four parts of our course, especially when we dive deep into specific projects. This page will remain static (it will not be updated), so use it as an archive that you can return to; start in this page position if you have questions about the schedule, procedures, expectations (above) ...then assignments (next).
